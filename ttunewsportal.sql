Takoradi Technical University was established as a Government Technical Institute. Motto: Adwen, Akoma na Nsa ma mpuntu\" (Skills combined with Wisdom accelerates development, Fante dialect).</font><br><font face=\"Arial\"></font></p><center><font face=\"Arial\"> &nbsp;<b><u>&nbsp;OUR HISTORY &amp; MANDATE</u></b></font></center><font face=\"Arial\">The Takoradi Technical University was established in September, 2016, as a result of the government’s policy to convert Takoradi Polytechnic, among five other Polytechnics, to the status of Technical University. In effect, since April 1954, Takoradi Technical University (formerly Takoradi Polytechnic) has existed as a Government Technical Institute under the Ghana Education Service of the Ministry of Education. During that period, the institute offered programmes mainly at the Craft and Technician Certificate levels in commercial and technical subjects, awarding Royal Society of Arts (RSA) and City and Guilds of London, United Kingdom. However, in 1990, the Ghana Education Service took over the awards of the above-mentioned certificates.<br></font><font face=\"Arial\">As part of the Ghana Educational Reforms which began in the 1980s, the Takoradi Technical Institute and five other similar institutions were upgraded by the Polytechnic Act 321 (PNDC Law 1993) to become part of the Ghana Tertiary Education System. The Polytechnics, per the law, began to offer Higher National Diploma (HND) programmers in the 1993/1994 academic year. These reforms mandated the polytechnics to compliment the role of the Universities to increase access to tertiary education for the training of middle and higher-level manpower.<br></font><font face=\"Arial\">A Bill proposed by the Ministry of Education and considered by Cabinet of Government in 2014 was passed by Parliament as an Act in August 2016 with the assent of the President, converting some polytechnics into technical universities as full-fledged technical universities. In view of that, the Takoradi Polytechnic Council adopted the name “Takoradi Technical University” which has been duly registered with the Registrar General’s Department of Ghana.<br></font><font face=\"Arial\">Currently, Takoradi Technical University has three (3) campuses: Effia Kuma (Takoradi), Butumagyebu (Sekondi) and Akatakyi (Agona-Nkwanta). The Akatakyi Campus is the largest of the three, with an acreage of 152.3.<br></font><font face=\"Arial\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </font><font face=\"Arial\"><center><u><b>MANDATE</b></u></center></font><font face=\"Arial\">The Takoradi Technical University, without limiting its other powers, shall;<br></font><font face=\"Arial\">1. Award degrees, diplomas, certificates and other qualifications as may be agreed upon by the Council of the Takoradi Technical University as established under section 4 of the Technical Universities Act, and approved by the national body responsible for accreditation.<br></font><font face=\"Arial\">2. Offer Higher National Diploma programmes approved, accredited, examined and certified by the national bodies responsible for Higher National Diploma programmes and awards.<br></font><font face=\"Arial\">3. Provide for the general welfare, recreational and social needs of staff and students of the Takoradi Technical University.<br></font><font face=\"Arial\">4. Exercise powers that are incidental to the achievement of the aims of the Takoradi Technical University.<br></font><font face=\"Arial\">5.

Develop appropriate attitudes and required skills in Information Technology (IT) and entrepreneurship to equip the students with such basic skills for industry.&nbsp;<br></font><font face=\"Arial\">7.

This, Prof. Micah, said would guarantee a smooth operation of the university and a drive towards TTU’s set of goals. The Pro Vice Chancellor said this at the opening of a four-day orientation for 173 newly employed staff including Senior Members, Senior Staff and Junior staff at TTU.</span></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\" face=\"Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: 38px; letter-spacing: -0.5px;\"><br></span></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\" face=\"Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: 38px; letter-spacing: -0.5px;\">&nbsp;</span></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\" face=\"Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: 38px; letter-spacing: -0.5px;\"><br></span></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\" face=\"Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: 38px; letter-spacing: -0.5px;\">Speaking on the Structure of the University, Policies and Procedures as one of the five topics treated on the first day of orientation, Professor Micah advised against converging at the Vice Chancellor’s office with concerns when they could follow the university’s structure. “Do not circumvent the structures of the university and rather go to converge at the VC’s office since personnel chats are not welcomed at the VC’s office. There is the need for members to limit themselves to the University Act and follow structures as well as regulations. You have to respect authority and make sure whatever your are doing goes through your supervisors”, he said.</span></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\" face=\"Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: 38px; letter-spacing: -0.5px;\">Professor Victor Kweku Bondzie Micah further urged senior members not to plagiarize but acquaint themselves with policies on plagiarism. He therefore emphasized the need for senior members to see research and publication as the new standard of measure for Universities worldwide. “Universities all over the world are measured by the research they do therefore I encourage you to lace your boots and do some research for publication at least once every year. Start early and do not wait till the ending of the year to publish. Also look for the right Journals to publish. TTU will support carrier developments as and when the university has funds. We are seeking sponsorship for PHD to support lecturers and members”, he added.</span></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\" face=\"Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: 38px; letter-spacing: -0.5px;\"><br></span></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\" face=\"Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: 38px; letter-spacing: -0.5px;\">&nbsp;</span></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\" face=\"Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: 38px; letter-spacing: -0.5px;\"><br></span></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\" face=\"Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: 38px; letter-spacing: -0.5px;\">Registrar of TTU, Dr. Moses Maclean Abnory, who opened the orientation challenged the newly hired staff to appreciate and buy into the vision of the University, and more especially not rely on what they already know.

This, Prof. Micah, said would guarantee a smooth operation of the university and a drive towards TTU’s set of goals. The Pro Vice Chancellor said this at the opening of a four-day orientation for 173 newly employed staff including Senior Members, Senior Staff and Junior staff at TTU.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Speaking on the Structure of the University, Policies and Procedures as one of the five topics treated on the first day of orientation, Professor Micah advised against converging at the Vice Chancellor’s office with concerns when they could follow the university’s structure. “Do not circumvent the structures of the university and rather go to converge at the VC’s office since personnel chats are not welcomed at the VC’s office. There is the need for members to limit themselves to the University Act and follow structures as well as regulations. You have to respect authority and make sure whatever your are doing goes through your supervisors”, he said.</p><p>Professor Victor Kweku Bondzie Micah further urged senior members not to plagiarize but acquaint themselves with policies on plagiarism. He therefore emphasized the need for senior members to see research and publication as the new standard of measure for Universities worldwide. “Universities all over the world are measured by the research they do therefore I encourage you to lace your boots and do some research for publication at least once every year. Start early and do not wait till the ending of the year to publish. Also look for the right Journals to publish. TTU will support carrier developments as and when the university has funds. We are seeking sponsorship for PHD to support lecturers and members”, he added.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Registrar of TTU, Dr. Moses Maclean Abnory, who opened the orientation challenged the newly hired staff to appreciate and buy into the vision of the University, and more especially not rely on what they already know.

Dr. Yaw Osei Adutwum, said TTU is on the right path with the strategic plan as a Technical University that has so far exceeded the national STEM target.<br><br></p><p>“Today if I look at TTU’s developed strategic plan and the projections of what it wants to do, it excites me on several fronts because it is a voluntary activity that nobody told them what to do. Again, Takoradi Technical University happens to be one of the few universities that have actually exceeded the STEM to humanities ratio. All this time, we have been talking about having 60% STEM to 40% humanities which at the national level is about 39% STEM to 61% humanities now, but TTU is at 80% STEM to 20% humanities. So you’re truly making giant strides and if you go on in that direction, you will become a good example to other universities”, he said.<br><br></p><p>The Education Minister also emphasized the importance of TTU’s strategic plan for tertiary education to contribute to societal development.<br><br></p><p>“Strategic plans are a blueprint for transformation taking from point A to Z, charting a course that we should take in order to realize our fullest potential. So as Takoradi Technical University embarks on this adventure of taking themselves from the current to the future, we (Education Ministry) want to commend you for the effort you put into the development of the strategic plan, especially the members of the committee who spent time to put the drafts together…There have been many inventions by universities with several of them holding patents around the world which is a demonstration of the fact that university education is an important public good and therefore countries are now prioritizing higher education.”<br><br></p><p>“It is in line with this that recently at the State of the Nation Address by the President, he spoke about the fact that Ghana needs to move up our Gross Tertiary Enrolment ratio. This is because nations that have transformed their fortunes in the 21st Century are the nations with a Gross Tertiary Enrolment Ratio that really provides them with the critical minds and critical mass for socio-economic transformation.”<br><br></p><p>”So in Ghana, our Gross Tertiary Enrolment Ratio is 18.8, but one country that we were better off than in 1960 in per capita income, thus South Korea which invested heavily in education all the way to tertiary now has a Tertiary Enrolment Ratio of 93.6“, he added.<br><br></p><p>The Vice Chancellor of TTU, Rev. Prof. John Frank Eshun, while thanking the strategic planning committee for putting together the strategy, gave the strategic themes of the 5-year strategic plan that came with the launch of a new website.<br><br></p><p>“The vision is to transform Takoradi Technical University to become an innovative, world-class institution of higher learning, rooted in quality teaching, learning and applied research. Our strategic plan has four broad themes and fifteen (15) strategic objectives. These themes have been carefully crafted from the Sustainable Development Goals. These broad themes are: Institutional development; applied research, innovation and infrastructure development; social development; and environmental development”, he said.<br><br></p><p>Giving the objectives of the 5-year strategic plan that would end in 2025, the Vice Chancellor of TTU said it sets the important milestones for the University and what it needs to do to position the University on the path of sustainable growth in the current competitive era.<br><br></p><p>“The strategic plan seeks to provide;<br>1. A clear objectives and direction for Takoradi Technical University<br>2. Identify and focus on viable and realistic strategies and activities<br>3. Promote optimum utilization of available resources (efficiency)<br>4. Promote maximum realization of stated goals and objectives (effectiveness)<br>5. Promote responsiveness to environmental forces – demands and expectations<br>6. Create opportunities for growth, expansion and sustainability<br>7. Improve the image of Takoradi Technical University through aggressive promotional campaigns and corporate branding<br>8. Set clear output and outcome targets and indicators against which Takoradi Technical University performance will be measured and judged.“<br><br></p><p>The Chairperson of the Governing Council of TTU, Dr. Henrietta Abane, said the Strategic Plan is timely which is key to the governing council and management’s reforms to make the university responsive to the needs of students as well as the society. She however made a case for the Special Disability Support Initiative to support the over 74 students with disabilities at the Takoradi Technical University.<br><br></p><p>“The Special Disability Support initiative seeks to help students with disability to access a range of support to help them succeed in their studies. This programme has become necessary in the light of the large numbers of students particularly with hearing impairment admitted to Takoradi Technical University over the last couple of years”, she said.<br><br></p><p>The Omanhene of Essikado Traditional Area, Nana Kobina Nketsia V who chaired the launching event said policies are so important in helping to develop the needed human resource with the right mindset for Western Region and for that matter Ghana’s development.<br><br></p><p>“The resource of the mind is so important that if we don’t have the correct mindset, everything will go waste… All our universities have become the outpost of the Western World and we all know that the Western world doesn’t like Africa and you don’t allow your enemy to educate you which is part of our problem. So this is the challenge that we have and Takoradi Technical University must show a unique example…You’re supposed to be the light of Africa. That is to tell you the problems that we are having and even the misgovernance that we are having is all through somebody else’s mindset. So long as you’re borrowing somebody’s mind, you will always be an ape. A university is to give us our own knowledge…and this university must mean something to all of us to commandeer resources to support it”, he said.<br><br></p><p>The Western Regional Minister, Hon. Dr. Kwabena Okyere Darko-Mensah who graced the occasion said TTU’s strategic plan is inline with the region’s development goals which must be supported.<br><br></p><p>“If we have Ghana Beyond Aid, then there should also be a Western Region Beyond Aid which is a strategic vision by the Western Regional Coordinating Council to become the model region of this country…. It is on this note I’m happy that the key objective of the TTU’s strategic plan is excellent teaching in applied research in such a way to make the university responsive to the needs of its stakeholders. We at the RCC have already started collaborating with the university…. We are developing business plans with the university for our districts to make the region ready for investment. We have also given them some major activities to undertake for the region. As I speak now, the Takoradi Technical University has developed a new model traffic light for our city and we are going to implement them soon. It is therefore our wish that this new strategic plan for the university would go a long way to make TTU the best in the country. We believe that they cannot do that without finance and therefore the idea of the fund for the University and the disables are thoughts in the right direction, the RCC will support you with this plan”, he said.<br><br></p><p>Hon. Dr. Kwabena Okyere Darko-Mensah added that Ghana must be developed by Ghanaians and Western Region must also be developed by westerners thus donated GHS30,000 to the fund.<br><br></p><p>This was followed by several donations towards the fund including GHS 20,000 donation by the MP for Effia, Hon. Joseph Cudjoe as the host MP of the university, GHS50,000 by the Education Ministry as well as GHS10,000 by the Takoradi Technical University Alumni.</p></div></div></div></div></div>', '2021-06-09 03:54:39', NULL, 1, 'TAKORADI-TECHNICAL-UNIVERSITY-OUTDOORS-GHS120-MILLION-5-YEAR-STRATEGIC-PLAN', '5aa1d38564d01e66974dedbb0e2dce30.jpg');

(21, 'TAKORADI TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OUTDOORS GHS120 MILLION 5-YEAR STRATEGIC PLAN', 3, 4, '<p>WORK PLAN MAKES YOU LESS STRESSFUL - TTU NEW STAFF ADVISED<br></p><p>A Deputy Registrar at the Takoradi Technical University and the Faculty Officer for the Faculty of Applied Sciences, Mrs Rebecca Asheley Clegg, has advised newly appointed staff of the University to uphold the principle of work planning as a gateway to stress-free workflow. Mrs. Clegg who gave the advise in a presentation on annual work plan preparation to newly appointed administrative staff of TTU said the concept of work plan is basically a design of responsibility work chart that makes working easier.</p><p>“If you don’t plan, you end up just wondering about hence the need to set yourself timelines. Planning helps one to decide what and when to do it...If you plan well, you execute your work well which is self motivating. It helps you to stay focus and able to make room for extra responsibilities, thus helps you to achieve results. Again this makes you less stressful. It also provides clarity for your work flow, steers you towards your set goals and can help you to track your targets”, she said.</p><p>The Deputy Registrar also challenged the newly administrative staff to be prompt with their expected monthly and quarterly reports.</p><p><br></p><p>“Administrators have to submit quarterly reports to their faculty heads. Compile each months report so you don’t pile up work by the end of the quarter. You must also move unfulfilled plans to the next month’s report and indicate that you could not do it...There is the need to make references to the annual academic calendar and highlight key areas that pertains to your job specification. You must also keep records of all correspondence to track all communications”, she added.</p><p>Touching on the importance of punctuality at work, Deputy Registrar and Faculty Officer at the Faculty of Engineering, Kenneth Boateng reminded the newly appointed administrative staff to dress well and be punctual at all time as it would be considered when the time come for their confirmation.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>TTU ENDS 4-DAY ORIENTATION FOR NEW STAFF WITH A CAUTION TO BE DISCREET, COMPLY WITH DIRECTIVES</p><p>21 MAY, 2021 BY WEBMASTER</p><p>The four-day orientation for newly employed staff of Takoradi Technical University has ended with a call on staff to respect all official directives, handle all communication as well as documents they come across with the expected confidentiality. A Deputy Registrar of TTU, Kenneth Boateng, in a presentation on Work Culture at the University who gave the call in addition said there is the need for the new staff to be punctual.</p><p>“We must be punctual in all we do. If a work is supposed to be done in a day, it should not be done in two days. You’re also to be discreet and handle documents that come to you with confidentiality. You cannot even talk to the media without the consent of authority”, he said.</p><p><br></p><p>The Deputy Registrar told the 173 new staff not to disgrace the interview panel and the university that gave a green light to their employment out of the over 6,000 applicants. He advised them to embrace training and development as well as the university’s culture of team work.</p><p>“We don’t work in isolation, so you need to do your work, push to the next level, let’s say the procurement for them to also finalize it for timely procurement of essentials for the running of the university...You can also be transferred to other departments to learn and be more beneficial to the university. We don’t transfer to punish but we transfer for you to learn other things and be more beneficial to the university.”</p><p><br></p><p>Dr. Moses Maclean Abnory who is the Registrar of TTU, responding to the questions on how to handle whistleblowers said persons with information on wrongful conduct that can hurt the university must consult appropriate authorities like the university Registery.</p><p>“if you notice a colleague is doing something wrong or criminal like the forgery of documents, use the appropriate channels like the registry to report for timely response. Please don’t also for the sake of wanting to destroy somebody attempt to report falsehood about anyone. That would be criminal and there is punishment for that”, he said.</p><p><br></p><p>The Registrar in his presentation on Human Relations and why it fails said the university is working towards a culture of servant leadership hence urged new staff to emulate that to allow subordinates to function. “Employees are expected to use some mechanisms such as effective communication, leadership and decision making to achieve good human relations and organizational objectives. When we say good communication, it is not the one that you speak with laud voice but the one you speak and wait to listen for a feedback. There is also the need to watch what you say because your actions or what you do can unmake TTU. Your behavior in this university and outside has a lot of impact on TTU”, he said.</p><p>Dr. Abnory further cautioned superiors not to abuse their subordinates. “You cannot treat human beings as machines. You see your subordinate is that tired but you still insist on certain deliverables. Show empathy!...Listen to their concerns to help achieve the best out of them. Relationship also fails when people take advantage of others who cannot also express it. You need to stay within your space as a manager or whatever position and not necessary Lord over people or interfere with their operations to allow them to function effectively”, he added.</p><p><br></p><p>He however took the new staff through TTU’s guidelines for a successful relationship and challenged them to observe the university’s dress code as well as become good ambassadors of Takoradi Technical University.

The 3406 capacity live engine was donated to the University under Mantrac Ghana’s Caterpillar Technician for Africa social responsibility programme to give students hands-on feel of industry engines.</p><p><br></p><p>The Vice Chancellor of Takoradi Technical University, Professor John Frank Eshun while receiving the engine at the Auto-tronic laboratory said it is timely as TTU through its recently launched five-year strategic plan is looking forward to such appropriate industry partnership support to achieve its mandate of a true Technical University that produces industry-cut technicians.“The Council, management and students appreciate Mantrac for coming to our aid with this equipment for training. We believe the academia-industry relationship that you have shown must be an example to all companies in our catchment. The University is there to help the industry with well trained technicians to help solve their problems or deliver their services. So we need to interact with industry to find out their problems to enable students solve problems with industry. That is why these Technical Universities were established. So there should be a strong relationship with the industry, and therefore your coming to donate such equipment is a very laudable thing that you have done and fits into our strategic plan. We will make good use of the equipment and keep interacting with you to see how best we can redesign our curriculum to meet your needs so that we will be able to address the needs of society”, he said.</p><p><br></p><p>The Component Rebuild Centre Operations Manager of Mantrac, Andrew Sarson, who handed over the engine encouraged TTU to incorporate the theoretical teaching with practicals, especially having the students at the field.</p><p><br></p><p>“The theory can be there but you must also have the practicality to help students have a feel of what is there. So we look forward to collaborating with TTU on our Technician for Africa Programme which is a programme for Africans seeking a new and exciting career as service technicians....We encourage the university authorities to adopt the T4A programme as part of the engineering department curriculum as this will give students an added advantage over their counterparts from other universities in terms of technical skills and practical know-how”, he said.</p><p><br></p><p>Dean of TTU’s Faculty of Engineering, Professor John Bentsil, said the faculty has been looking forward to using the Caterpillar engine for practical since its arrival hence the formal handing over marks the beginning of critical practical training to ready students for the job market.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Mr. James Tawiah Kwame Aggrey, who is the Principal Technician at the Electro-Tronic Laboratory explained how essential the live engine would impact on their training.</p><p>“The heavy duty Caterpillar engine is a complete engine. This engine can be fitted into so many earth moving machines, for example the dozer or caterpillar grader. We can use this engine for demonstrations and parts identification for students. These are physical component that when you go to the job market you will be able to identify. After schooling, these are the exact components you are going to work with. So we train students as to how to identify for example the turbo charger, how it is fitted and how it looks like....Live engine means that this engine can be put into running”, he said.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Mantrac Ghana in addition to the donation extended invitation TTU Engineering students to visit its ultra-modern Component Rebuild Centre at Ewusiejoe for further practical feel of what they are leaning.</p><p><br></p>', '2021-06-09 10:16:39', NULL, 1, 'TTU-TO-PROVIDE-JOB-READY-TRAINING-IN-PHOTOVOLTAIC', '8aa78f49a7b35fc3b5809ac0890767a1.jpg'),
